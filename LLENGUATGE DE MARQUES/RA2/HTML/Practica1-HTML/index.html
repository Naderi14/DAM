            <h3>Review:</h3>
            <p>
                Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is a story about Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands into a fantasy
                world that is full of weird, wonderful people and animals. It is classic children's book that is also popular with adults. Personally,
                at 16, I found the book strange and uninteresting.

                However if I was 8-14 I would have loved the fantastic fantasy world Carroll creates. I never expected the events that happened
                because they were bizarre and unpredictable. I loved the Cheshire cat's wit and
                intelligence. I also love the hatter because his eccentric personality reminded me of the eccentric people I know. My favourite
                part was when Alice met the caterpillar, this was because of his ambiguous conversation with Alice.

                However, I thought the events were sometimes random and didn't always connect. I also disliked the number of characters, this
                is because sometimes I found it uninteresting and sometimes it meant that I didn't have the development of scenes I wanted.
                I believe that it is a clever book that I world have preferred when I was younger because now I have a different taste in books.
                Carroll has depicted a unique world that I hadn't seen before. This why I believe it is a book that I would recommend.
